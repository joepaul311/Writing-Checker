I was serenaded by Cat Stevens and his guitar. Speaking of guitars, they may exemplify usefulness in the art of scrap wood to bury so that one may have rich, nutritious, and legit soil. Who do you you you you you! (AH) you you give the soil to? Your friends can't digest them because of their metallic covered stomach that are made from metal by their parents. I think I legit very much quite like you because that's how the soil meatball bounces in my soil by the garden.
