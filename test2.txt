Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff (1873-1943), born in Oneg, Russia to Vasily Arkadyevich Rachmaninoff and Lyubof Petrovna Butakova, was a dramatic pianist with powerful chords and popular melodies. Rachmaninoff began playing at the age of four - his grandfather and father were both musically inclined, which certainly had an effect on his playing. From the urging of his grandfather, Rachmaninoff’s father brought a piano teacher from Moscow to begin his training. However, like the two generations before him, Rachmaninoff and his brothers were expected to join the army. Eventually, though, his father gambled away their money, leading them to move to St. Petersburg. Rachmaninoff’s aunt offered to take him in, and managed to get him a scholarship to study piano at the St. Petersburg Conservatoire, as well as take other classes. Eventually, his father left his wife and children resulting in no more pressure to join the military. Eventually he moved into Nikolai Zveref’s estate, where strict discipline and practicing habits were created which eventually resulted in Rachmaninoff’s technical prowess at the piano. After staying with Zveref for three years, he attended the Russian Conservatoire, where he graduated in 1892.
His Op. 23 Prelude no. 5 in g minor was published in 1901, at the age of 34.  It is a march in the ternary form, where the A sections are marches and the B section features a more melodic theme. The entire piece stays in g minor. The piece starts off with the A section, which is an upbeat march. This first theme of the A section makes up #1-9. A slight variation on this is repeated #10-16. The second theme is introduced at #17 and goes through #22, when at #23 a transition turns back to the first theme beginning again at #25. The A section begins to taper down, as if the listener was fading away to a past memory, from #30 to #34. Finally, the B section begins at #35, which was as if the listener was recalling a prior event fondly. The B section is divided into two repeating parts. The first time, the part should be played pianissimo, and crescendo over #39 to reach the first “mini” climax at #40. #41 returns to piano, where the theme is repeated with a more distinguished voice. The top of the right hand acts as the most readily heard voice, with the middle voice coming at a softer volume. The accompaniment should be played the softest. #46 should begin a crescendo that climaxes at the end of #47, where there is a heavy rubato. The climax of #47 should bleed into #48, and only slowly diminuendo down to piano and then pianissimo finally at #50. The A section picks up again, and plays through similarly, with the first theme of the A section playing up until #63, with the second theme playing #64 to #70, with a transition back to the main theme at #72. The final theme should start out fortissimo, and slowly diminuendo around #80 through the rest of the piece. #84, 85, and 86 should all be piano and the two ending chords should be played with a sharp staccato, which is an almost ironic or comical ending to the march.
